- Pygame?


<<<<<<<<{{{ commit 01039d3bb4ad7635db09958d21d0d59e13bcf0c8 }}}>>>>>>>>
Notes:
- We're gonna implement the visualisation part of the project in pygame
- Going to test implementating image scaling of the input PNG file to fit display of a certain dimension.
    - I discovered that scaling the image too much from it's original dimensions cause the image to end up lower quality.
      I suppose it might be better that I look into displaying image of it's original dimensions if it's reasonable...?

- Implemented diplaying of the floorplan image in tester.py
