- Pygame?


<<<<<<<<{{{ commit 01039d3bb4ad7635db09958d21d0d59e13bcf0c8 }}}>>>>>>>>
Notes:
- We're gonna implement the visualisation part of the project in pygame
- Going to test implementating image scaling of the input PNG file to fit display of a certain dimension.
    - I discovered that scaling the image too much from it's original dimensions cause the image to end up lower quality.
      I suppose it might be better that I look into displaying image of it's original dimensions if it's reasonable...?

- Implemented diplaying of the floorplan image in tester.py


<<<<<<<<{{{ commit d5d29fbf4ee17f01d925238cc38f71613eb289b5 }}}>>>>>>>>
- Implemented skeleton floors.py
- Implemented skeleton of features.py
  - Going to finish after this commit :D

Note that I have not tested this as of yet.


<<<<<<<<{{{ commit 1e368087724b0576585c7918f12ddb0ba31f0204 }}}>>>>>>>>
- Implemeneted Nodes, but not yet expansion.


<<<<<<<<{{{ commit 6471a82776b5dbbebb3b964dbef1f1bc85bf420c }}}>>>>>>>>
We're going to begin implementing a simple traversal algorithm

- Implemented BFS
- Implmented A* Search
- Implemented Dijkstras

I can probably begin on the visualisation section before adding more features?
